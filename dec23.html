        <h2>The Season</h2>
        <p class="author">Reflection by Renee Beauregard Lute</p>
        <p>It isn't writer&apos;s block, exactly. It&apos;s a three-year-old and an almost-two-year-old and this tiny baby I&apos;m gratefully carrying right at this very minute, who makes me vomit more frequently than I&apos;d like. It&apos;s school board meetings and exhaustion and trying to keep up with housework. I haven&apos;t been writing. I have nothing to submit to my critique group for the month of December, and the guilt is chewing me up. I&apos;m not feeling guilty because I&apos;m letting anyone else down &mdash; I&apos;m feeling guilty because I&apos;m letting ME down.</p>
        <p>Didn&apos;t I pride myself on doing it all? Don&apos;t I always write &ldquo;writer and mother&rdquo; in the occupation line on various forms? It doesn&apos;t seem honest, these days. What have I written lately?</p>
        <p>This is the thing that has been like a rock in my shoe all season. A couple of days ago, I sent an email to an old critique partner. She wrote back this morning, and it was everything I needed to hear.</p>
        <blockquote>&ldquo;The writing will come. Let yourself off the hook a little. I was listening to a podcast about our lives having &ldquo;seasons&rdquo; and how our focus shifts with each one. It&apos;s been helpful for me to remember&mdash; this season of taking care of little kids will go by relatively (the operative word!) quickly.&ldquo;</blockquote>
        <p>Winter always seems like the longest season, but it is as quick as the others. Advents and Christmasses from years ago seem like they lasted a half-second of time. She&apos;s right &mdash; this is the season for taking care of little kids, and growing our third and very last baby. It&apos;s the season for ordering take-out too often, because the smells of cooking are too much for me a lot of the time. It&apos;s the season to be wrapped up in my children, and perhaps, when there&apos;s time, whether I find it or steal it or pay a babysitter and make it, it&apos;s the season to write just a bit.</p>
