        <h2 class="author">Reflection by Lori Birrell</h2>
        <p>As we prepare for advent, we are also preparing ourselves for the second coming of Christ: "Judgment Day". Are you ready? In today's reading of 1 Thessalonians 5: 12-28, the parts that were most meaningful to me are: <em class="bible">"And we urge you, brothers, admonish the idle, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with them all. See that no one repays anyone evil for evil, but always seek to do good to one another and to everyone. Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you."</em></p>
        <p>For me personally, to live a good Christian life, I look for opportunities where I can help others who are less fortunate. I am currently volunteering at Issaquah Community Services, a non-profit organization serving residents of Issaquah and Sammamish who are in need of emergency financial rental assistance to avoid eviction or emergency financial utility assistance to avoid shut off of power or water. Many of these life necessities we take for granted because we have been blessed with good jobs, good health, good relationships with our families and spouses, and a great caring and supportive church family such as St. Michael's.</p>
        <p>Working for the non-profit is very rewarding because I am forced to step out of my comfort zone and get involved with meeting people who have very low incomes and are barely able to meet their day to day needs. Some of our clients do not have jobs due to being a single parent with children, or have a disability that prevents them from earning a wage. Some are homeless, have a drug addiction, or have mental health issues that prevent them from holding on to a job. Most of our clients not only need financial assistance, but need a real person they can talk to and who will listen. It is very rewarding to help someone in hard times, especially when the assistance allows them to get back on their feet.</p>
        <p>I know there are many members of St. Michael's that give their time to God by helping in different ways. Advent is the time for us all to reflect and look for ways that we can do more.</p>
