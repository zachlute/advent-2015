        <p>In this passage a woman was brought before Jesus by the scribes and Pharisees because she had been caught as an adulterer. Jesus said to them, <em class="bible">&ldquo;Let anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.&rdquo;</em></p>
        <p>I recall the last time this passage was spoken to me. It was by my sister who hadn&apos;t been to church really at all in her adult life. She, I, my 2 older brothers and my 80 year old Dad were standing outside of the apartment where my younger brother had died of an accidental drug overdose, preparing ourselves to go in and pack up all his belongings, and knowing that there would be things in that apartment that would be very uncomfortable for us to witness, let alone handle.</p>
        <p>My sister handed us all a beautiful polished amethyst stone. She then said, &ldquo;Let anyone among us who is without sin cast the first stone.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Clearly God was working through her to prepare us for that day. I cherish that stone. It is a lesson I will never forget.</p>
