          <p><em class="bible">&ldquo;Now set out captive hearts free, YHWH<br/>
            Make them like streams in the driest desert!<br/>
            Then those who now sow in tears<br/>
            Will reap with shouts of joy&hellip;&rdquo;</em></p>
          <p>Psalm 126, The Inclusive Bible</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>These verses made my heart tingle when I read them! In other translations I consulted they didn&apos;t touch me the same way, even when I could see they were the same verses. There&apos;s just something about freed hearts, desert streams and no more sowing in tears that made me think this Psalm was written just for me! Certainly I&apos;ve had arid times in my spiritual life, like deserts desperately needing streams, and I&apos;ve had what seem like WAY too many tears of sorrow. I&apos;m guessing you might have, too.</p>
        <p>So what does the Psalmist mean about captive hearts? I&apos;ve pondered that quite a bit over the last few days. I&apos;ve decided that is/has been true of me in ways both large and small &mdash; things that keep me from nearness to God. There have been times of tragedy in which I felt furious with and alienated from God, even though I knew in my head that God is large enough to contain my fury. There are little things that hold my heart captive, too, like enjoying food too much, especially that which might not be the best choices for me. Or committing to too many things &mdash; keeping too busy to allow time with God. I take so many blessing for granted, and that, too, may hold my heart captive, for when I&apos;m thankful my heart feels unchained.</p>
        <p>This Advent I commit to being aware daily of ways in which I allow my heart to be held captive, and will hold firm to the promise in <span class="bible">Psalm 126</span>. I will then know streams in my desert places and will <em class="bible">&ldquo;reap with shouts of joy&rdquo;</em>. It&apos;s not that there won&apos;t be sad or difficult times, but I will see more clearly then that God is with me and sustains me in all times.</p>
