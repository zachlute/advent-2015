        <p>The readings for today talk about obeying God&apos;s ordinances and laws; we seek His help in keeping firm in our faith despite the wickedness of the world around us. Oftentimes when we are feeling weak and distracted, remembering and acting on His Word by &ldquo;going through the motions&rdquo; gets us through. Psalm 119 says, <em class="bible">&ldquo;Though the snares of the wicked are twined about me, your law I have not forgotten.&rdquo;</em> and <em class="bible">&ldquo;I considered my ways and turned my feet to your decrees.&rdquo;</em></p>
        <p>Advent has always reminded me of my First Holy Communion. I was raised from birth in the Catholic Church, attended Catholic schools and First Holy Communion was a <em>huge</em> deal.</p>
        <p>I remember the steps and orderliness that culminated in that special Sunday: We spent months memorizing the catechism and our responses, all of the first grade classes came together to rehearse the procession, say the responses in unison and practice kneeling and receiving communion&mdash;over and over and over.  I remember the specialness of picking out a dress and veil, receiving my own white-covered prayer book and solemnly choosing a rosary.<p>
        <p>Advent and preparing for the coming of Jesus&apos;s birth is like the ritual of preparing for Holy Communion: we focus on the steps, try to keep distractions of the season at bay and remember to keep our eyes, hearts and minds focused on what we are celebrating at Christmas time.</p>
