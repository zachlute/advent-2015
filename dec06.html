        <h2>Saint Nicholas Day</h2>
        <p class="author">Reflection by Melanie Violette</p>
        <p>To me, the start of Advent is not first Sunday of Advent (this year, November 29) but Saint Nicholas Day (December 6).</p>
        <p>When I was a child, my family lived in an apartment in DÃ¼sseldorf, West Germany. The first year we were there, we left our apartment on the morning of December 6 to find a magical surprise waiting just outside our door. There were three child-sized plastic boots, each filled with candy! The neighbors upstairs explained, with a twinkle in their eyes, that Saint Nicholas had visited us in the night. Every year after that, my brothers and I each left a shoe outside our door before we went to bed December 5, and found Saint Nicholas&apos;s bounty there in the morning.</p>
        <p>Since moving to Issaquah in 2010, our family has enjoyed attending the Saint Nicholas Breakfast at Saint Michael&apos;s. There&apos;s nothing quite like pancakes, singing carols, and Saint Nicholas himself telling us stories to get us in the holiday mood. We have also made a tradition of picking out our Christmas tree that afternoon, and purchasing a gift for the Giving Tree.</p>
