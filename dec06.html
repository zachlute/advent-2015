        <p>December has always been a wonderful time of year for my family. It begins with Thanksgiving and a big home-cooked meal. In early December, we shop for presents and decorate our tree. We watch Christmas shows and listen to Christmas music. In mid-December, we decorate the outside of our house and go in search of beautiful light displays in other neighborhoods. A few days before Christmas, we wrap our gifts and put them in obvious places under the tree so theyâ€™ll be noticed by their recipients. The excitement builds right up to Christmas Eve.</p>
        <p>Christmas morning is always a flurry of activity. We have breakfast first (originally a suspense builder, but now its something we really enjoy). Then we take turns opening our gifts around the tree. Eventually we call our relatives to wish them a Merry Christmas, and the rest of our day is spent relaxing, discovering our gifts, and enjoying each other&apos;s company.</p>
        <p>Anticipation is a big part of Christmas. It always has been. In fact, Advent is the season of waiting as we prepare our hearts for Christ&apos;s return. But Advent is also a time of reflection. We should use this time to think about our spiritual journey with Christ. Are we growing with Christ? Are we truly listening for God&apos;s voice in our hearts? And perhaps most importantly, what are we doing about it?</p><p>Merry Christmas to each of you, and may you find peace, comfort, and and joy in our Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
