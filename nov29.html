        <h2>Enough! Prepare! Await!</h2>
        <p class="author">Poem by Jason Allen Anderson</p>
        <div>
          <p>The earth journeys&mdash;away from the sun, away from warmth, away from light&mdash;<br/>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and prepares for the season to come:</p>
          <p>Trees, whipped by fierce winds, shed their yellow, orange, red, and sienna leaves.<br/>
             Larch, filled with green-turned-golden needles, stand bare on the mountain sides.<br/>
             Even the evergreens&mdash;pine, hemlock, fir&mdash;cast off some of their needles.</p>
          <p>And it seems people mimic and match the earth&apos;s apparent death and retreat&mdash;<br/>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;becoming cold, unfeeling, forgetful, ignorant, unkind, dark.</p>
          <p>Gripped by fear of the unknown, doors and hearts close to a world in need&mdash;<br/>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;refugees, prisoners, widows, orphans.<br/>
             Pulled into premature Christmas filled with red- and green-washed platitudes,<br/>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;minds enter a corporate-fueled consumerist frenzy.<br/>
             Flooded with chintzy Christmas d√©cor of Charlie Brown trees to programmable LED lights,<br/>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spirits seem helpless as Advent expectation is washed away.<p>
          <p>Enough! Prepare! Await!</p>
          <p>Close not your doors and hearts to a world in need&mdash;for now is the time to fling wide the gates!<br/>
             Walk not the common path&mdash;for what you profess is not common!<br/>
             Sing not the songs of Christmas&mdash;for now is the time of Advent!</p>
          <p>&ldquo;Build up, build up, prepare the way, remove every obstruction from my people&apos;s way.&rdquo;</p>
