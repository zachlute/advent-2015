        <p>As I approach Advent I immediately think &mdash; YES! This is my favorite time of the church year. And I love the decorations, songs and upbeat mood everywhere. I think back to Advents past and am overwhelmed by the amount of Love in the world during this time of preparing for the celebration of Jesus's birth. And I sense this reflected back to me everywhere I go. People are changed &mdash; I am changed. Love permeates the air and it is both infectious and contagious. I am met with smiles everywhere I go, someone waves me &lsquo;in&rsquo; their line of traffic, I feel I want to help everyone in need in some way&hellip;love is just over-flowing. God is within each of us and making a fireworks display.</p>
        <p>Most everyone here in our part of the world has heard of Jesus, but I don&apos;t think most recognize Him. Yet, unbeknownst to them they participate also as they are infected, with more open hearts and outpouring of giving and receiving, and all without recognizing him. This is the magic of Christmas for me: the expansion of Love in everyone &mdash; believers, seekers and unbelievers alike &mdash; all of us participating in this monumental occasion without even being aware of the Source. We have our scrooges too, but even they can be melted. And this awareness of Love expands year after year. It&apos;ll never be done – our growing in Love.</p>
        <p>Spiritual giants of our time say that in today&apos;s world people want to know God. They want to experience Him. How shall I know? How shall I prepare for this new display of &ldquo;God’s kingdom at hand?&rdquo; And I wonder, what does it mean to prepare? There are probably as many ways to prepare as there are people, but for me preparing is opening up to new ways of seeing through &lsquo;practice.&rsquo;  Religious traditions are rich in practices. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a one size fits all, but to practice means consciously doing something to further prepare to know. I discovered a practice just over 6 years ago that has opened my heart to know God in ways I never would have imagined &mdash; called &lsquo;Centering Prayer&rsquo; &mdash; a type of meditation that has, as its core intent, consent to God&apos;s presence and action in my life and then sitting quietly for a period of time twice a day. Jesus said &mdash; <em class="bible">the Kingdom of God is within&hellip;</em> and I thought what better way to seek it.</p>
        <p>And I know: Love is the greatest force in the universe. To love is to participate in God. To love and be loved is to heal.</p>
        <p>I wish you your greatest experience of Advent yet!</p>
