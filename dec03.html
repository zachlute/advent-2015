        <h2 class="author">Poem by Andrew Violette</h2>
        <p>Every day, I look in that mirror and say &ldquo;Everything will be alright.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>People reflect each other. When one is happy, the other follows suit; the same is true for anger and excitement. So many connections like these happen so rapidly that emotions move through people like waves. Rippling from person to person, a good day cascades outward in a tsunami of uplifting energy. Bad days on the other hand- well, they creep and slither and skulk, their foul miasma strangling otherwise blissful dreams and replacing them with kraken-filled nightmares.</p>
        <p>I aspire to be the moon&mdash; always pulling upwards, trying to brighten the waves of emotion that reverberate through everyday life. To the troughs, she radiates the calm tranquility of &ldquo;Live to fight another day.&rdquo; To the crests, she extends their exultation with the passionate &ldquo;Fight to live another day!&rdquo; She performs a constant balancing act, calming their torrents of emotion into a cool upwelling of serenity. In the tranquil water of a thousand peaceful eyes, she then sees a pale face, shimmering in the liquid stillness. Her face.</p>
        <p>Every day, I look in that mirror and say &ldquo;Everything will be alright.&rdquo;</p>
