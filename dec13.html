            <h2>Seasonal Trumpeting</h2>
            <p class="author">Poem by Renee Beauregard Lute</p>
            <p>
              A voice says cry out.<br>
              What shall I cry?<br>
              What shall I cry when my faith is a faint bulb<br>
              in a large, cold room?<br>
              Well, it isn't all dark I suppose.<br>
              It could be colder, and it isn't.<br>
              This is not a stirring cry.<br>
              <br>
              A voice says cry out.<br>
              What, Voice? What shall I cry?<br>
              My faith is an ice skate in a closet box,<br>
              and I have not considered it like this since last year.<br>
              It's seasonal, but nice. It's nice to have.<br>
              This is not a proclamation.<br>
              <br>
              We are so close to Christmas<br>
              and even now, I am no heavenly host before shepherds.<br>
              I am no crier of news, no bringer of joy.<br>
              I am the shepherds themselves, hurrying from their nighttime fields,<br>
              finding the family,<br>
              peering into the manger.<br>
              <br>
              I am the sheep themselves,<br>
              shrugging fleecy shoulders.<br>
              What shall we cry?<br>
              What shall we cry?<br>
              Until the shepherd pulls us in,<br>
              carries us close, warms us,<br>
              lights up even the largest, coldest room.<br>
            </p>
