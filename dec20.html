        <h2>Trust Fall</h2>
        <p class="author">Reflection by Kim Kankiewicz</p>
        <p>In Psalm 89, we read of God&apos;s covenant with His people. God&apos;s faithfulness is established in heaven itself. It transcends time and stretches across generations. Yet sometimes following God feels like a trust fall.</p>
        <p>You may have participated in a trust fall, a team-building activity in which one group member falls backward into the interlocking arms of the remaining members. If you&apos;ve taken the plunge, you&apos;ve experienced a free-falling sensation and probably some uncertainty about your team&apos;s reliability or ability to support you. Following God can feel like this. You may have the same butterflies in your stomach and the same nagging doubts about the outcome.</p>
        <p>Reading further into Psalm 89, you&apos;ll find three references to God&apos;s arms. When I first noticed this, I became curious about the significance of this particular anatomical feature. I was surprised to discover numerous references to God&apos;s arms throughout the Bible&mdash;and surprised at how, collectively, they strengthened my faith. When the Christian life feels risky, it helps to remember whose arms are waiting to catch you.</p>
        <p>Here&apos;s what the Bible says about God&apos;s arms:</p>
        <h3>God&apos;s arms are not human arms.</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <em class="bible">How you have helped the powerless! How you have saved the arm that is feeble.</em><br/>
          Job 26:2
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <em class="bible">Do you have an arm like God&apos;s, and can your voice thunder like his?</em><br/>
          Job 40:9
        </blockquote>
        <h3>God&apos;s arms are strong.</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <em class="bible">Your arm is endued with power; your hand is strong, your right hand exalted.</em><br/>
          Psalm 89:13
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <em class="bible">&hellip;With a mighty hand and outstretched arm; his love endures forever.</em><br/>
          Psalm 136:12
        </blockquote>
        <h3>God&apos;s arms are gentle.</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <em class="bible">He tends his flock like a shepherd: He gathers the lambs in his arms and carries them close to his heart; he gently leads those who have young.</em><br/>
          Isaiah 40:11
        </blockquote>
        <h3>God&apos;s arms are holy.</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <em class="bible">Sing to the Lord a new song, for he has done marvelous things; his right hand and his holy arm have worked salvation for him.</em><br/>
          Psalm 98:1
        </blockquote>
        <h3>God&apos;s arms will fight for you.</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <em class="bible">With him is only the arm of flesh, but with us is the Lord our God to help us and to fight our battles.</em><br/>
          2 Chronicles 32:8
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <em class="bible">You crushed Rahab like one of the slain; with your strong arm you scattered your enemies.</em><br/>
          Psalm 89:10
        </blockquote>
        <h3>God&apos;s arms will redeem you.</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <em class="bible">Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the Lord your God brought you out of there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm.</em><br/>
          Deuteronomy 5:15
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <em class="bible">But they are your people, your inheritance that you brought out by your great power and your outstretched arm.</em><br/>
          Deuteronomy 9:29
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <em class="bible">With your mighty arm you redeemed your people, the descendents of Jacob and Joseph.</em><br/>
          Psalm 77:15
        </blockquote>
        <h3>God&apos;s arms will bless you.</h3>

        </blockquote>

          1 Kings 8:42
        </blockquote>

          Isaiah 52:10
        </blockquote>
        <h3>God&apos;s arms will sustain you.</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <em class="bible">My hand will sustain him; surely my arm will strengthen him.</em><br/>

          Isaiah 30:30
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <em class="bible">My righteousness draws near speedily, my salvation is on the way, and my arm will bring justice to the nations. The islands will look to me and wait in hope for my arm.</em><br/>
