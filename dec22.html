          <blockquote class="bible">
            <p>Thomas (who was called the Twin), one of the twelve, was not with the other disciples when Jesus came. So the other disciples told him, &ldquo;We have seen the Lord.&rdquo; But he said to them, &ldquo;Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands, and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side, I will not believe.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>A week later his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were shut, Jesus came and stood among them and said, &ldquo;Peace be with you.&rdquo; Then he said to Thomas, &ldquo;Put your finger here and see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it in my side. Do not doubt but believe.&rdquo; Thomas answered him, &ldquo;My Lord and my God!&rdquo; Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Have you believed because you have seen me? <u>Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have come to believe.&rdquo;</u></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Do I believe in God? I don&apos;t remember a time when I would have answered anything other than yes. I&apos;ve got a letter thanking my grandfather for his 25 years of service on the vestry and pictures of my grandmother leading the children&apos;s choir at Holy Cross Episcopal Church in Brooklyn, NY.  My father was an acolyte&hellip; Karen and our two children were all baptized by our Father Bob Brown when he was our priest here at St. Michael&apos;s, back in the 70&apos;s.</p>
          <p>To clarify, let me call my belief an intellectual belief for much of this time. I could stop and think;: yes I believe in God, I believe Jesus is his son, born of a woman, here to prove man could live without sin, to instruct and guide us and to lead us in the hereafter&hellip;</p>
          <p>Last spring I suffered a horrific accident. Bad enough to be a &ldquo;guest&rdquo; of Harborview&apos;s trauma center for a full week.  One night, lying in bed, I was reflecting on all the family and friends that had contacted Karen and/or me to say they were praying for me. It occurred to me that so many were from Saint Michael&apos;s and that I also knew &mdash; from some that contacted us &apos; that there were many others also praying for me. As I pondered my recent past, the present (between operations) and future in light of all the prayers on my behalf I felt a palpable buoying up of myself, as though lifted on the hands of all those praying for me. It was as though I was, without words, being told, &ldquo;It will be okay. Donâ€™t fear.&rdquo; This was a visceral, palpable, wordless experiencing of God&apos;s love FAR beyond any intellectual belief I had ever experienced.</p>
          <p>In his latter years I recall my father saying, &ldquo;I&apos;d feel much better about dying if I could talk with someone who&apos;s been there.&rdquo; This was his way of expressing his intellectual belief in God at that time. I can now truly say: I &ldquo;&hellip;<u>have not seen and yet have come to believe</u>.&rdquo;</p>
