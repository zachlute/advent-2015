          <p>&ldquo;Hallelujah!&rdquo;</p>
          <p>It&apos;s one word, but probably the most important word in the Book of Psalms; it means &ldquo;praise Jah&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Praise I AM!&rdquo; It was a group shout to open the most important celebrations of the liturgical year. If you can mean and feel it, you have a warm gratitude toward our Lord which will open your heart to Divine love.  At this level we are all connected.</p>
          <p>One of our Baptismal vows is to seek and serve Christ in all persons. I don&apos;t have a clue as to how to do this without opening my heart. Turbulence in human affairs brings waves of fear that slam it shut. I can feel changes in relaxation, breathing, and attitude when fear is unloaded by Grace. I say, &ldquo;It sure feels good feeling good again.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>In the fifth century, Leo the Great said &ldquo;No one is shut out from this joy.&rdquo; Our prayer at our celebration, &ldquo;Hosanna in the highest,&rdquo; is part of our work to assist in Christ&apos;s great work of healing the human family.  It means &rdquo;Save now, we pray.&rdquo; Meaning and feeling this will allow us to be brought out of feeling shut out and into feeling included, which we were in the first place.</p>
          <p>Hallelujah!  Jesus is born and dwells among us!</p>
