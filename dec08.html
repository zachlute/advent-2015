        <h2>Christmas Villains</h2>
        <p class="author">Reflection by Kim Kankiewicz</p>
        <p>Psalm 27 acknowledges wickedness, the enemies and foes that besiege us. Have you ever considered the number of Christmas stories involving villains? You might be surprised when you first stop to think about it. Then again, most compelling stories rely on the triumph of some form of good over some form of evil. Considering that Christmas honors the birth of the ultimate good who triumphed over ultimate evil, it&apos;s not so strange that the stories we tell this time of year feature some pretty nasty characters.</p>
        <p>The letters we send at Christmastime tend to tell happier stories. And what better time to reflect on the blessings of family, health, livelihood, and leisure? If we&apos;re honest, though, none of us has spent the past year in a Norman Rockwell painting. Even if our external circumstances haven&apos;t been especially difficult, our internal stories are never without conflict.</p>
        <p>When the trimmings and trappings of the season leave us with the nagging sense that we&apos;re not as merry and bright as we should be, may we find joy in the bigger story of Christmas. When God came to earth as a newborn child, he submitted himself to the trials of the human condition so we could ultimately escape them. Meanwhile, God&apos;s presence brings encouragement and hope to our earthly lives, opening our eyes to the abundance of each new day.</p>
        <p>In case you need a temporal laugh in the meantime, I offer this countdown:</p>
